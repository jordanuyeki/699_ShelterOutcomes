# Predicting Shelter Animal Outcomes

This repository contains my code and relevant resources for my final project for my Machine Learning Lab class as part of the University of San Francisco's Data Science Masters program. 

The goal of this project was to build a Machine Learning Classifier Model to accurately predict the outcomes for dogs and cats in the rescue and shelter systems.  For this project, I used the 'Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes' Dataset which is publically available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and).
