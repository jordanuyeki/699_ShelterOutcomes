# Predicting Shelter Animal Outcomes

I am a current Data Science masters student at the University of San Francisco. This repository contains my code and relevant resources for my final project for my Machine Learning Lab Class (MSDS 699). 

The goal of this project was to build a Machine Learning Classifier Model to accurately predict the outcomes for dogs and cats in the rescue and shelter systems.  For this project, I used the 'Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes' Dataset which is publically available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and).

The notebook of my analysis is in this repository but feel free to check out this [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/project/991bf65f-5702-4acf-9b2d-58cd25d741ba) to run through my project. 

For this project, I leveraged sklearn functionalities. I did a cross validation randomized search to identify the best Machine Learning Classifier model and its optimal hyperparameters. My final model with the best performance was the RandomForestClassifier() model which achieved an accuracy score of 0.775 on the witheld testing data.
